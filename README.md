## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
### What I learned
 - Translate CSS -  I have been using margin left like a total newbie. This just opened my eyes to new opportunities I never thought was possible. 

### Continued development
 - CSS semantics. I am very much lacking in them.

### Useful resources

- [Translate CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref//css_pr_translate.php) - I have been using `margin-left` and `margin-top` to move items on a page. Never again.
